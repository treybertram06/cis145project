# Documenting my Journey

## Integration of Course Skills
- **HTML**: Created an HTML document with forms and tables.  
- **CSS**: Styled the page using `hsl`/`hsla` for color themes and improved accessibility.
- **JavaScript**: Added functionality to toggle themes and hide incomplete table rows.  
- **Accessibility**: Implemented ARIA attributes and error messages to make forms accessible.

## New Learning Experiences
- Designed a form with multiple input types (text, email, date, radio, checkboxes, and file uploads).  
- Ensured form elements were validated using required attributes and provided user feedback.
- Used Javascript to easily allow the user to switch themes.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Issue**: Updating CSS with a button.  
- **Solution**: Used an inline `<style>` block and JavaScript for updates.

- **Issue**: Ensuring valid form inputs.  
- **Solution**: Added `required` attributes to all required fields.

- **Issue**: Hiding rows with incomplete projects.  
- **Solution**: Used JavaScript to iterate over rows and conditionally hide them.
